Staying Organized & Productive
Always mention the task ID (e.g., T026) and file path when you need help or make a change.
Reference plan.md, research.md, or contracts/ excerpts when handing me context—less guessing, cleaner results.
Keep git tidy: branch per feature slice, small commits, run tests before each commit.
Document decisions in docs/notes/decision-log.md as they arise.

**Prompt/Response Handshake**
- You issue a request with the classification upfront (e.g., “Task Update: Please implement T026…”).
- I reflect it back, confirm understanding, highlight any missing prerequisites, and point out if running a spec-kit command (clarify/plan/tasks) would help.
- I wait for your go-ahead before executing substantive work.
- After execution, I report results plus any follow-up questions or recommended next commands.
