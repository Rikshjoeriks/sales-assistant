# Feature Specification: Test Files Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `001-clean-up-test`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Clean up test files in SpecMatcher project - remove redundant and obsolete test files to improve project organization"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the SpecMatcher project, I want to clean up redundant and obsolete test files so that the project structure is cleaner and easier to navigate, reducing confusion and maintenance overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a SpecMatcher project with multiple test files, **When** I identify and remove redundant test files, **Then** the project should have a cleaner structure with only necessary test files remaining
2. **Given** obsolete test files that no longer serve their purpose, **When** I remove them, **Then** the project should maintain its functionality without the removed files
3. **Given** test files that duplicate functionality, **When** I consolidate or remove duplicates, **Then** the project should have improved organization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a test file appears obsolete but might be needed for future development?
- How does the system handle test files that are referenced by other parts of the codebase?
- What if removing a test file breaks the build or CI/CD pipeline?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all test files in the project directory structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST categorize test files by type (unit tests, integration tests, obsolete tests, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST determine which test files are redundant or obsolete
- **FR-004**: System MUST safely remove identified redundant test files
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve test files that are actively used or referenced
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain project functionality after test file removal
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a summary of removed files and their impact

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TestFile**: Represents individual test files with attributes like path, type, last modified date, and usage status
- **ProjectStructure**: Represents the overall project organization and file relationships
