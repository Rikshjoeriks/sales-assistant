# Feature Specification: Empty Files and Small Code Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `002-clean-up-empty`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Clean up empty files and small files with minimal code - analyze smaller files first to determine if they are necessary to keep"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the SpecMatcher project, I want to clean up empty files and small files with minimal code so that the project structure is cleaner and only contains necessary files, reducing maintenance overhead and improving project organization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with empty files, **When** I identify and remove them, **Then** the project should have no empty files remaining
2. **Given** files with minimal code, **When** I analyze their necessity and remove unnecessary ones, **Then** the project should only contain files that serve a purpose
3. **Given** small files that might be needed, **When** I assess their usage, **Then** I should preserve files that are actively used or have future value

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a small file appears unnecessary but might be needed for future development?
- How does the system handle files that are referenced by other parts of the codebase?
- What if removing a small file breaks the build or CI/CD pipeline?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all empty files in the project directory structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify files with minimal code content (under specified size threshold)
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze the purpose and usage of small files
- **FR-004**: System MUST determine which small files are necessary to keep
- **FR-005**: System MUST safely remove identified unnecessary empty and small files
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve files that are actively used or referenced
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain project functionality after file removal
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a summary of removed files and their impact

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ProjectFile**: Represents individual files with attributes like path, size, content type, and usage status
- **FileAnalysis**: Represents the analysis results for each file including necessity assessment
