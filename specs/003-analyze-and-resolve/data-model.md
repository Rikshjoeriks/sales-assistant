# Data Model: Comprehensive Project Issue Resolution

**Feature**: 003-analyze-and-resolve
**Date**: September 19, 2025

## Overview
This document defines the data entities and relationships for the comprehensive project issue resolution system. The model captures issues, quality metrics, and performance benchmarks to support systematic code quality improvements.

## Core Entities

### Issue
Represents individual project issues identified through code analysis.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `type`: Issue category (enum: line_length, trailing_whitespace, multiple_statements, unused_variable, broad_exception, complex_function)
- `severity`: Impact level (enum: high, medium, low)
- `location`: File and line information (object)
  - `file_path`: Absolute path to affected file (string)
  - `line_number`: Line number where issue occurs (integer)
  - `column_number`: Column number (integer, optional)
- `description`: Detailed issue description (string)
- `status`: Current resolution status (enum: open, in_progress, resolved, wont_fix)
- `fix_status`: Automated fix availability (enum: auto_fixable, manual_fix, no_fix)
- `metadata`: Additional issue-specific data (object)

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to: CodeQualityReport (many-to-one)
- Has many: FixAttempt

**Validation Rules**:
- `id` must be unique within project
- `location.file_path` must exist
- `severity` determines prioritization order

### CodeQualityMetric
Represents measurable quality indicators for code assessment.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `metric_type`: Type of quality metric (enum: complexity, duplication, coverage, maintainability)
- `value`: Current metric value (number)
- `threshold`: Acceptable threshold value (number)
- `unit`: Unit of measurement (string, e.g., "cyclomatic_complexity", "percentage")
- `target_file`: File being measured (string, optional)
- `measurement_date`: When metric was calculated (datetime)
- `trend`: Recent trend direction (enum: improving, stable, declining)

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to: CodeQualityReport (many-to-one)

**Validation Rules**:
- `value` must be numeric
- `threshold` must be defined for each metric type
- `measurement_date` must be current or historical

### PerformanceBenchmark
Represents performance measurements and optimization targets.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `benchmark_type`: Type of performance metric (enum: execution_time, memory_usage, api_calls, file_processing)
- `value`: Current measurement value (number)
- `unit`: Unit of measurement (string, e.g., "seconds", "MB", "calls")
- `target_value`: Desired performance target (number)
- `measurement_context`: Test scenario details (object)
  - `input_size`: Size of test input (string)
  - `hardware_specs`: System specifications (object)
  - `software_versions`: Relevant software versions (object)
- `measurement_date`: When benchmark was taken (datetime)

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to: PerformanceReport (many-to-one)

**Validation Rules**:
- `value` and `target_value` must use same unit
- `measurement_context` must include test scenario details

## Report Entities

### CodeQualityReport
Aggregates quality metrics and issues for reporting.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `project_name`: Name of analyzed project (string)
- `analysis_date`: When analysis was performed (datetime)
- `total_files`: Number of files analyzed (integer)
- `total_issues`: Total issues found (integer)
- `issues_by_type`: Breakdown by issue type (object)
- `issues_by_severity`: Breakdown by severity (object)
- `auto_fixable_count`: Number of issues that can be auto-fixed (integer)

**Relationships**:
- Has many: Issue
- Has many: CodeQualityMetric

### PerformanceReport
Aggregates performance benchmarks for analysis.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `test_scenario`: Description of performance test (string)
- `execution_date`: When test was run (datetime)
- `duration_seconds`: Total test duration (number)
- `success_rate`: Percentage of successful operations (number)

**Relationships**:
- Has many: PerformanceBenchmark

## Supporting Entities

### FixAttempt
Records attempts to resolve issues.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `issue_id`: Reference to related issue (string, foreign key)
- `attempt_date`: When fix was attempted (datetime)
- `fix_type`: Type of fix applied (enum: automated, manual, partial)
- `success`: Whether fix was successful (boolean)
- `before_code`: Code before fix (string)
- `after_code`: Code after fix (string)
- `validation_results`: Results of fix validation (object)

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to: Issue (many-to-one)

**Validation Rules**:
- `issue_id` must reference existing Issue
- Either `before_code` or `after_code` must be provided

### ProjectConfiguration
Stores project-specific settings and preferences.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (string, required)
- `project_root`: Root directory path (string)
- `analysis_excludes`: Files/patterns to exclude from analysis (array)
- `quality_thresholds`: Custom quality thresholds (object)
- `auto_fix_enabled`: Whether automated fixes are enabled (boolean)
- `backup_before_fix`: Whether to backup files before fixing (boolean)

**Validation Rules**:
- `project_root` must be valid directory path
- `analysis_excludes` must be valid glob patterns

```

## Data Flow

1. **Analysis Phase**: CodeQualityReport created with Issues and Metrics
2. **Fixing Phase**: FixAttempts created for each Issue resolution
3. **Validation Phase**: PerformanceReport created to verify improvements
4. **Reporting Phase**: All entities aggregated for final assessment

## Migration Considerations

- Existing pylint output can be parsed into Issue entities
- Performance benchmarks can be collected incrementally
- Fix attempts should be logged for audit trail
- Configuration should be backward compatible

## Future Extensions

- Add Issue dependencies and blocking relationships
- Include code churn metrics in quality assessment
- Add team assignment and ownership tracking
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated analysis
