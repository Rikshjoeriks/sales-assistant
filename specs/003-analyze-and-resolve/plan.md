**Language/Version**: Python 3.x (detected from .py files and __pycache__)  
**Primary Dependencies**: OpenAI API, Tkinter (GUI), SQLite3, pathlib, tqdm  
**Storage**: SQLite databases (feature_dictionary.db, learning_dictionary.db), CSV files, text files  
**Testing**: No formal testing framework detected, manual validation approach  
**Target Platform**: Windows (detected from PowerShell usage and file paths)  
**Project Type**: Single desktop application with GUI  
**Performance Goals**: Efficient processing of automotive specification matching with OpenAI API integration  
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing functionality while improving code quality  
**Scale/Scope**: ~14 Python files, ~2800+ lines of code, 259 identified issues

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on constitution.md analysis:
- [ ] Library-First principle: Project appears to be a single application rather than modular libraries
- [ ] CLI Interface: No CLI interface detected, GUI-only application
- [ ] Test-First: No evidence of TDD approach or comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Integration Testing: No integration tests detected
- [ ] Observability: Basic print statements for logging, no structured logging
- [ ] Versioning: No version management detected
- [ ] Simplicity: Code shows complexity issues that need resolution

**Status**: NEEDS ASSESSMENT - Constitution principles not fully implemented

**Structure Decision**: Maintain current single project structure (Option 1) - no need for web/mobile split

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - OpenAI API version compatibility → research current API structure
   - Testing framework options → research suitable Python testing frameworks
   - Code quality metrics → research pylint/other analysis tools
   - Performance bottlenecks → research profiling tools for Python

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research OpenAI API v1.x compatibility for Python applications"
   Task: "Find best practices for Python code quality improvement"
   Task: "Research automated code fixing tools for Python"
   Task: "Find Python testing frameworks suitable for existing codebase"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: Use pylint for analysis, autopep8/black for formatting
   - Rationale: Industry standard tools with good Python support
   - Alternatives considered: flake8, pycodestyle

**Output**: research.md with all unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Issue: type, severity, location, status, fix_status
   - CodeQualityMetric: complexity_score, duplication_ratio, coverage_percent
   - PerformanceBenchmark: execution_time, memory_usage, api_calls

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - analyze_issues() → returns issue analysis report
   - fix_issue(issue_id) → applies automated fix
   - validate_fixes() → runs tests to ensure no regressions

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test issue analysis accuracy
   - Test automated fix application
   - Test validation procedures

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Analyze 259 issues → categorize by type
   - Apply fixes → verify improvements
   - Validate functionality → ensure no regressions

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Add Python code quality tools to context
   - Add OpenAI API compatibility information
   - Preserve existing project knowledge

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each issue type → automated fix task [P]
- Each code quality metric → improvement task [P]
- Each performance benchmark → optimization task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Priority order: High-impact fixes first (ui.py with 380 issues)
- TDD order: Analysis before fixes, validation after fixes
- Dependency order: Core utilities before dependent modules
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent file fixes)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| No formal testing framework | Legacy codebase migration | Adding tests to existing code requires careful integration |
| GUI-only interface | Desktop application design | CLI not suitable for user-friendly spec matching workflow |
| Multiple large files | Existing architecture | Refactoring would break functionality during transition |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: COMPLETED
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: COMPLETED
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
