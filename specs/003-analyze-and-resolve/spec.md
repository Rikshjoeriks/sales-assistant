# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Project Issue Resolution

**Feature Branch**: `003-analyze-and-resolve`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Analyze and resolve 259 project issues - identify main culprits and implement comprehensive fixes for code quality, performance, and maintainability"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the SpecMatcher project, I want to systematically identify and resolve the 259 project issues so that the codebase is more reliable, maintainable, and performant, reducing technical debt and improving development velocity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with 259 identified issues, **When** I analyze the main culprits, **Then** I should have a clear categorization of issue types and their impact
2. **Given** categorized issues, **When** I implement targeted fixes, **Then** the project should show measurable improvements in quality metrics
3. **Given** resolved issues, **When** I validate the fixes, **Then** the project should maintain its core functionality without regressions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when fixing one issue creates new issues elsewhere?
- How does the system handle issues that require architectural changes?
- What if some issues are false positives from analysis tools?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and categorize all 259 project issues by type and severity
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze the main culprits causing the majority of issues
- **FR-003**: System MUST prioritize issues based on impact and effort required
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement automated fixes for code quality issues
- **FR-005**: System MUST optimize performance bottlenecks identified in the analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST enhance error handling and logging throughout the application
- **FR-007**: System MUST improve code documentation and maintainability
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that all fixes maintain existing functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive reporting on issue resolution progress
- **FR-010**: System MUST establish preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Issue**: Represents individual project issues with attributes like type, severity, location, and status
- **CodeQualityMetric**: Represents measurable quality indicators like complexity, duplication, and coverage
- **PerformanceBenchmark**: Represents performance measurements and optimization targets
