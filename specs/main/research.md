- Kelley Blue Book API: Market values and comparisons

**Enhancement APIs**:
- Google Search API: Real-time competitive intelligence
- Sentiment Analysis APIs: Customer communication tone analysis
- Text-to-Speech APIs: Voice output for hands-free scenarios

## Knowledge Processing Architecture

### Text Processing Pipeline
1. **Document Ingestion**: PDF/text parsing for books and manuals
2. **Content Segmentation**: Chapter/section chunking for efficient retrieval
3. **Key Concept Extraction**: Identify sales principles, technical features, communication techniques
4. **Embedding Generation**: Vector representations for semantic search
5. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Relationship mapping between concepts

### Recommended Libraries
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber for text extraction
- **NLP**: spaCy for text processing, sentence-transformers for embeddings
- **Vector Search**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS for semantic retrieval
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector storage

## Sales Psychology Framework

### Core Principles to Extract and Apply
**Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion**:
- Reciprocity: Creating obligation through value delivery
- Commitment/Consistency: Leveraging stated preferences and past decisions
- Social Proof: Using testimonials, reviews, popularity indicators
- Authority: Establishing credibility and expertise
- Liking: Building rapport and similarity connections
- Scarcity: Limited availability, exclusive opportunities

**Customer Personality Types** (DISC Model):
- Dominant: Direct, results-focused, decisive
- Influential: Social, optimistic, enthusiastic  
- Steady: Patient, reliable, team-oriented
- Conscientious: Analytical, precise, systematic

**Objection Handling Framework**:
- Listen and acknowledge concerns
- Clarify the underlying issue
- Provide evidence-based responses
- Confirm resolution and move forward

### Implementation Strategy
- Create personality detection based on customer input language
- Map psychological principles to specific customer scenarios
- Generate principled responses with clear reasoning chains
- Track effectiveness of different approaches by customer type

## Technical Specification Processing

### Automotive Data Structure
**Vehicle Specifications**:
- Performance: Engine specs, acceleration, top speed, fuel economy
- Safety: NHTSA ratings, IIHS awards, safety feature lists
- Technology: Infotainment, driver assistance, connectivity features
- Comfort: Interior space, cargo capacity, seating configurations
- Reliability: Warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, resale value

**Competitive Analysis Framework**:
- Feature comparison matrices
- Price positioning analysis
- Advantage/disadvantage identification
- Value proposition mapping

### Processing Approach
- Structured data extraction from specification sheets
- Benefit translation (feature â†’ customer value)
- Competitive differentiation highlighting
- Cost-of-ownership calculations

## Communication Enhancement

### Writing Style Adaptation
**Formal Business Writing**:
- Professional tone, detailed explanations
- Supporting data and evidence
- Clear value propositions and ROI calculations

**Conversational Sales Scripts**:
- Natural language flow
- Question-based engagement
- Emotional connection techniques
- Closing language patterns

**Presentation Content**:
- Visual storytelling frameworks
- Key message hierarchies
- Persuasive slide structures
- Call-to-action optimization

### Content Generation Strategy
- Template-based approach with dynamic content insertion
- Style transfer based on customer profile and context
- A/B testing framework for message effectiveness
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Storage Strategy
**Knowledge Base**: PostgreSQL with full-text search and vector extensions
**Session Management**: Redis for temporary customer context and conversation state
**File Storage**: Local filesystem or S3 for original documents and generated content

### API Design Approach
**RESTful Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/customers` - Customer profile management
- `/api/v1/knowledge` - Knowledge source management
- `/api/v1/recommendations` - Sales content generation
- `/api/v1/feedback` - Interaction outcome tracking

**CLI Interface**:
- `sales-assistant recommend --customer-id X --context "scenario"`
- `sales-assistant learn --source book.pdf --type psychology`
- `sales-assistant feedback --interaction-id X --outcome success`

### Development Priorities
1. **MVP Core**: Single knowledge source ingestion + basic recommendation generation
2. **Multi-Source Integration**: Combine all three knowledge types with conflict resolution
3. **Advanced Personalization**: Customer profiling and adaptive recommendations
4. **Learning Systems**: Feedback processing and recommendation improvement
5. **API Scaling**: Rate limiting, caching, performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **API Costs**: ChatGPT usage could become expensive with scale
  - *Mitigation*: Response caching, model selection optimization, usage monitoring
- **Knowledge Quality**: Inconsistent or conflicting information in sources
  - *Mitigation*: Source verification, conflict detection algorithms, manual review processes
- **Performance**: Large knowledge bases may slow retrieval
  - *Mitigation*: Vector search indexing, content preprocessing, query optimization

### Business Risks
- **Accuracy Concerns**: Incorrect sales advice could damage customer relationships
  - *Mitigation*: Source attribution, confidence scoring, human review workflows
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Sensitive business information in knowledge bases
  - *Mitigation*: Access controls, audit logging, data classification systems
