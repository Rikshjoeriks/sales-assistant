# Feature Specification: Core Knowledge Ingestion & Sales Content Generation

**Feature Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Start with feeding one sales book, one technical specification from a car, and one different book. See how we can create some results using ChatGPT API and potentially other APIs."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a car salesperson, I want to input a customer situation (e.g., "30-year-old professional looking for reliable family car, budget $35k, concerned about safety") and receive personalized sales talking points that combine psychological persuasion techniques, specific technical car features, and compelling communication approaches.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** three knowledge sources (sales psychology book, car technical specs, communication/writing guide), **When** user provides customer context, **Then** system generates 5-10 tailored sales points with source attribution
2. **Given** a customer objection ("This car is too expensive"), **When** user requests objection handling, **Then** system provides 3-5 response strategies combining psychology principles and technical value justifications
3. **Given** different output format requests (email, presentation bullet, casual conversation), **When** user specifies format, **Then** system adapts the same core message across all requested formats
4. **Given** successful sales interaction feedback, **When** user logs the outcome, **Then** system captures learning for future similar situations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when customer context is too vague or incomplete?
- How does system handle conflicting information between knowledge sources?
- What if requested car model isn't in the technical specifications?
- How does system respond when no relevant sales psychology principles apply?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest and parse three types of knowledge sources: sales psychology literature, automotive technical specifications, and communication/writing guides
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept customer context input including demographics, needs, budget, concerns, and decision-making style
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate personalized sales recommendations by combining insights from all three knowledge domains
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide source attribution for each recommendation, showing which book/specification informed each point
- **FR-005**: System MUST adapt output format (formal email, bullet points, conversation scripts, presentation slides)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle objection scenarios by suggesting counter-arguments backed by psychology and technical data
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture user feedback on sales interaction outcomes for continuous learning
- **FR-008**: System MUST interface with ChatGPT API for natural language processing and generation
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain conversation history and context across multiple interactions
- **FR-010**: System MUST support adding new knowledge sources without system redesign

### Key Entities
- **Knowledge Source**: Represents a book, manual, or document with metadata (type, title, author, key concepts)
- **Customer Profile**: Demographics, preferences, concerns, decision-making style, communication preferences
- **Sales Context**: Situation details, product interest, stage of sales process, previous interactions
- **Sales Recommendation**: Generated talking point with source attribution, confidence level, and format variations
- **Interaction Log**: Record of customer interaction, techniques used, outcomes, lessons learned

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Initial Requirements Gathering (2025-09-24)

**Q1: What specific types of sales psychology concepts should the system extract and apply?**
**A1**: Focus on core persuasion principles (reciprocity, social proof, authority, commitment/consistency, liking, scarcity), objection handling frameworks, customer personality types (analytical, driver, expressive, amiable), and closing techniques. The system should identify which principles apply to specific customer scenarios.

**Q2: What level of technical detail should be extracted from automotive specifications?**
**A2**: Extract practical selling points: safety ratings and features, fuel efficiency, performance specs (horsepower, torque, acceleration), technology features (infotainment, driver assistance), warranty coverage, maintenance costs, and competitive comparisons. Focus on features that translate to customer benefits.

**Q3: What type of "different book" would provide the most value for communication enhancement?**
**A3**: A professional writing/communication guide focusing on storytelling techniques, emotional engagement, clarity of expression, and persuasive writing. This could include humor usage, metaphors, analogies, and adapting communication style to different personality types.

**Q4: How should the system prioritize conflicting recommendations from different knowledge sources?**
**A4**: Establish a priority hierarchy: Customer context drives selection, sales psychology provides the approach framework, technical specifications provide the evidence/proof points, and communication guidelines shape the delivery format. When conflicts arise, default to the approach most likely to build trust and address customer's primary concerns.

**Q5: What constitutes successful feedback for the learning system?**
**A5**: Track outcomes like: customer engagement level (interested, neutral, resistant), objections raised, techniques that resonated, final decision (purchase, continued consideration, no interest), and salesperson's subjective assessment of recommendation effectiveness. Use this to refine future recommendations for similar customer profiles.

**Q6: Should the system support real-time interaction during sales calls?**
**A6**: Initial version should support preparation and follow-up scenarios. Real-time support can be added later but requires different technical considerations for speed and interface design.
